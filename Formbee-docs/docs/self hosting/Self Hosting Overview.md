## How Self-Hosting works with Formbee

We provide docker images with varying form submission functionality. The idea behind this is you get to self host something minimal (only what you need).

We are actively working to provide comprehensive coverage of all the different methods for self-hosting form submissions, including email, webhooks, and more.

### After you have the backend running, how do you access it?

Once your server is running locally or hosted via docker, there is no dashboard, you are meant to access the API endpoints directly from your frontend. The Documentation for each Docker Image contains the available endpoints, and how to use them.
