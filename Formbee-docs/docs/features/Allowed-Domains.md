# Allowed Domains

You can restrict the domains that can submit forms to your FormBee account. This is useful because API keys on your client-side code can be discovered. By restricting the domains that can submit forms, you can prevent this from happening. 

## How to use it?
In the [Dashboard](https://formbee.dev/dashboard), on the main page, you can see the **Allowed Domains** section. Here you can add domains that are allowed to submit forms to your account.
