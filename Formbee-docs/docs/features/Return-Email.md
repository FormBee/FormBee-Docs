# Auto Return Email

FormBee can automatically send a return email to the user after they submit a form. This feature is unavailable on the Free plan. On the Growth plan, you can send return emails from a formbee email address, and on the Premium plan, you can send return emails from any email address.

## How to connect my own email address?
If no email address is set, the return email will come from a formbee email address.

In the [Dashboard](https://formbee.dev/dashboard), on the main page, you can see the **Sign Into Return Email** Button.
After clicking it a modal will appear. Here you can log into your gmail account with google oauth, or set up a custom SMTP email address.

## Changing the Return Email Content
At the bottom of the modal, you can see the **Subject** and **Body** fields. Here you can change the subject and body of the return email.
