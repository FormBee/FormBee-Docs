# Pow Captcha

A PoW Captcha aka, a [Proof of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) Captcha is a captcha that requires the users device to solve a small computational problem in order to pass the captcha. This is effective against bots and other automated programs because it can be computationally expensive if performed on a large scale, making it difficult for bots to overwhelm the system. The task usually involves hashing or solving a puzzle that takes a minimal but measurable amount of processing power to solve, preventing automated attacks while remaining user-friendly for legitimate visitors.

## How to use it?
The PoW captcha API is only available on the Growth, and Premium plans.

We use [Altcha](https://altcha.org/) to power our PoW captcha.
