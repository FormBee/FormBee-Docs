# Discord

FormBee can send Discord notifications to your Discord server when a form is submitted using webhooks.

## What is Discord?

Discord is a free, voice, video, and text chat platform designed primarily for gamers but has since expanded to various communities and uses. Discord allows users to create and join servers, which are organized into channels

## How to integrate FormBee with Discord?

In the [Dashboard](https://formbee.dev/dashboard), on the main page, under **plugins**,you can see the **Discord** section.

Here you can add your Discord webhook URL, and the channel to send the notification to.

### Where to find my webhook URL?

To find the webhook URL, go to the discord channel where you want to send the notifications, and click on the settings icon it says **Edit Channel**. Then click on **Integrations** and then **Webhooks**. Click New Webhook, and copy the webhook URL.

Add this URL to your FormBee Discord plugin.

With that, your form submissions will be sent to your Discord channel.
