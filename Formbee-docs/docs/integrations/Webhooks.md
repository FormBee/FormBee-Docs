# Webhooks

FormBee can send form submissions to webhooks.

## What is Webhooks?

A webhook is a method used to deliver data from one application to another, typically by making an HTTP POST request to a specified URL. Webhooks are often used for real-time data transfer and automation, allowing systems to communicate efficiently.

## How to Integrate FormBee with Webhooks?

In the [Dashboard](https://formbee.dev/dashboard), on the main page, under **plugins**,you can see the **Webhooks** section.

Here you can add any webhook URL, and FormBee will send a POST request to that URL with the form data.
