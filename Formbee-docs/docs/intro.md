# What is [FormBee](https://formbee.dev)?

FormBee is an [open source](https://github.com/formbee/formbee) form backend service that allows you to manage your form submissions, and send them to your email, or use any of our [integrations](https://docs.formbee.dev/docs/category/integrations) to send submission data to your favorite apps.

## Why FormBee?

I wasn't satisfied with existing form backend services, their pricing, or what they could be using my data for. So I created FormBee, and open-sourced it allowing other developers to self-host our form submission service, or use our budget-friendly hosted service with the same data privacy.

We offer **Better Privacy**, and **Better Pricing** than any other form backend services, and we're **Open Source** so you can self-host FormBee if you want.

### Why would someone need a form backend service?

The browser by itself isn't able to do much with the data from a form. You need to send the data to a server, and then the server needs to process the data and send it to the right place. This is where form backend services come in. They allow you to send the form data to a server, and then the server can process the data and send it to the right place without the need to write any server-side code. This speeds up the development process, removing the need for you to write server-side code, or host a server.
